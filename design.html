            <p>- her right eye is missing</p>
            <p>- her body is burnt and patched up</p>
            <p>- she usually hides that with bandages</p>

            <p>All of the artists ever drawing her or helping me out with official arts.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>This design can easily be used for any voicebank and any cover. It shows her in a sky blue off-sholder top with puffy sleeves and wool socks as well as a large brown skirt and oversized boots. Her body is covered in bandages and ribbons to hide her patches.</p>

                <figcaption>KOI-m (Korean/Russian) [Art: aiQue]</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This design is used as a design for her Korean and Russian voicebank. The dress is inspired by traditionally Korean clothes (Hanbok dresses) and some Russian costumes. Even though her clothes are different, the general colour scheme stays the same.</p>

            </figure>  
            <p>This design is used for her French voicebanks. It features a blue shirt and tartan skirt as well as brown shoes, buttons and a beret. Additionally, she wears bandages and ribbons as usually.</p>

                <figcaption>KOI-m (Bluemoon)</figcaption>
            </figure> 
            <p>This design is used for her Bluemoon append. It looks differently to most of the designs before as it tries to be more futuristic and have this "space aestetic". It's mainly kept in a teal color with some golden details.</p>

            </figure> 
            <p>This is a design made for her English banks which tried to be Dark Academia before this even was a thing. She is wearing a brown dress with a white blouse as well as the casual bandages and ribbons again.</p>

                <figcaption>KOI-m (Left: Dolly) (Right: Childish)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The Dolly design was published with the first Dolly bank and was supposed to show her process of growing up (she's more comftable in her body and wears less bandages). The Childish design is just a cutesy version of her normal design specifically made for that append.</p>

                <p>There is not fullbody for this append. It's all up to your imagination.</p>

                <figcaption>KOI-m (Power)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This is just what it seems to be, the normal design but darker and with messy hair. But I think the drawing is cute considering it's made for a power append.</p>
            <br>

                <img src="-mari-new.png", width="70%">
                <figcaption>KOI-m (Wtf)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This can be seen as an alternative to the main design. At some point I just thought giving her a more complex design and really working on the cute-creepy doll concept would fit her very well. I like this design for revealing her patches though.</p>

            <h2>Descriptions</h2>
            <p>(This is mainly just copied from her <a href="http://utau.wiki/utau:theresa-thea-contralto">Utau Wikidot</a>.)</p>

            <h3>Recent:</h3>
            <br>
            <p>(1) German CVCV -Crystal- (Multiexpression):</p>
            <p>A nice voicebank to use if you plan on doing a German cover but want to spice things up by switching between soft whispery vocals and powerful yelling.</p>
            <br>
            <p>(2) German CVVC -Contralto- (Multipitch):</p>
            <p>A smooth sounding voicebank featuring the natural voice of Thea. It has a slightly better quality than the first voicebank due to the multipitch support.</p>
            <br>
            <p>(3) (Mainly) English CVCV -Bluemoon- Act 2 (Multipitch):</p>
            <p>A voicebank which is capable of singing decent English, it supports quite some other languages as well. It is recorded in three pitches which is why it sounds similar to the second bank.</p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Outdated:</h3>
            <br>
            <p>German CV Outdated Act 1:</p>
            <p>A soft but yet powerful contralto female singing voice with the focus on singing in German. Misses a few important samples, outdated.</p>
            <br>
            <p>German CV Outdated Act 2:</p>
            <p>Adds a few more samples to make her more flurent. Good base for several languages, only tested out in English, German and French though.</p>
            <br>
            <p>French CV:</p>
            <p>Features a single French CV reclist with nasal vowels and all this stuff.</p>
            <p>WARNING: Y- SAMPLES MISSING; YOU NEED THE 2nd GERMAN ACT TO GET THEM FROM THERE! (They are called J- samples there.)</p>
            <br>
            <p>English/Multilingual -Bluemoon- Act 1 + German Add-On:</p>
            <p>Recorded in Bluemoon style (developed by AWNye) with a few extra samples to make her more flurent at German. Can sing probably any language in this world, seriously, Bluemoon is great. Tested in: English, French, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, German, Czech, Polish, Norwegian, Russian, Finnish, Spannish</p>
            <br>
            <p>English CV-VV Outdated:</p>
            <p>Features her typical voice but with a more accurate pronounciation, Akialist focused on the English part.</p>

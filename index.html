            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Name: Manon</p>
            <p>Alias: Zimtroeschen or Zim-P</p>
            <p>Pronouns: she/her or they/them</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hey, I'm Manon - a rather small Vocal Synth producer from Germany. For my music (mainly covers of Vocaloid songs) I prefer using UTAU and SynthesizerV in many different languages. Most of my videos and drawings feature dark subject matter as I love horror.</p>
            <p>My absolute favourite Anime are Shiki and Death Note, my favourite Manga are Ousama Game, Noah of the Blood Sea and Shiver on the other side. And yeeees, KOI-m is heavily influenced by Mary from IB - that's like one of my prefered game.</p>
            <p>Beside liking horrific stuff, I'm also interested into history and know to much about Phonographs. Recently, I'm about to study computer science to work at HLT (language technology basically). Maybe one day I will learn how to write pretty webpages as well...</p>
            <h2>Important</h2>
            <p>As I already mentioned, I'm very investigated into hellish mathematical lectures and other things you need for my studies, thus I have not to much time to keep producing, as I had back in the old days. That's why I might need some time to upload something new or answer to your replies.</p>
